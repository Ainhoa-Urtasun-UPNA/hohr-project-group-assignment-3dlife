## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities
***
* Your company's name: **3Dlife**
* Your company's NAICS (at least 4-digit) code and associated description from [NAICS Search](https://www.naics.com/search/): 
* **339112 Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing**

Description: This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing medical, surgical, ophthalmic, and veterinary instruments and apparatus (except electrotherapeutic, electromedical and irradiation apparatus). Examples of products made by these establishments are syringes, hypodermic needles, anesthesia apparatus, blood transfusion equipment, catheters, surgical clamps, and medical thermometers.

* Corporate name and total employees of the top 3 businesses (Click To View Corporate Businesses by Revenue):

**3DLife Bioprinting, Inc.**
 **Top 3 businesses:**
 
Baxter International Inc -> Total employees: 47,000

Fresenius Medical Care North -> Total employees: 18,500

Medline Industries Inc -> Total employees: 12,000

Total employees of the top 3 businesses = 77,500

* Number of businesses in your NAICS code from [Market Research](https://www.naics.com/market-research/): 
* 339112	- Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing =	5,737
* List of your company's primary activities divided into engineering activities and operational activities:

Our primary activities are related directly to the creation of the multilayered objects such as tissues and organs from soft biomaterials like living cells and biomimetic synthetic polymers, using the latest technological advances in the field. Primary activities are divided into engineering activites and operations activities. 
                 
3Dlife's research engineers mainly work theoretically and analytically, they carry out experiments before the implementation, for instance, bioprinting a heart the size of a cherry, with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers, which is developed from the patient's own fat tissue.  They will carry out studies, and prototypes, for example, using only a human cornea they can print 50 artificial ones, thanks to 3D technology. This is a big advance in ophthalmology. One important activity of the engineers is using computer-aided design (CAD) to design and map the organs which are done layer by layer.

Operational activities performed by 3Dlife's operators consist on obtaining and handling materials such as bioprinting skin, whose market is growing fast. In order to print an organ, cells of the specific organ are needed, these cells are called bioink. Operators make sure that this material is on the machine. Operators also set up the tools and machines needed for the printer, such as a print head mount, elevator, platform, sensors... 3Dlife operators carry out the production of the organs, and lastly they perform a very strict quality control to assure the highest performance of the organs created. 


List of your company's support activities:
***
Support activities are responsible for planning and oversight of primary activities. These support activities include general management, human resource management, and finance.

A key support activity at 3Dlife is performed by its maangers. They decide on the course of action that the company will take and guide all the company members through it. Managers at 3Dlife organize and coordinate how activities are going to be carried out. Managers also make sure the value chain runs properly and efficiently. Managers at 3Dlife want the company to be at the top position in bioprinting and using the latest technologies available. For achieving this, they thake a close look to their main competitors. Lastly, managers at 3Dlife should be leaders. They influence all 3Dlife members to work together with the interest of the organization. 

Human resources department for 3DLife needs to find qualified workers, as well as hard working, customer centric and creative. Moreover, it is very important for the Human Resources management to provide periodic additional training to its workers, as they are in a very innovative industry which is constantly changing.

In order to finance the big investment required, the company takes advantage of funds provided by investors in the project and subsidies by the government for Research and Development activities. However, 3D life also leases 3D printers from other companies to reduce costs.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***
One of the main tasks of HR is to forecast the number of available of workers in the future so that 3Dlife is able to make better hiring decisions. For this prediction, we have used matrix multiplication. M is a square matrix of order 3 x 3. In m11=5 we have the number of managers who remain in the same occupation after one year, m22=10 indicates the number of engineers who remain in the same occupation after one year and m33 = 45 the number of operators who have remained in the same position after one year time. In this same M matrix, for instance we have m31 = 5 the number of managers that moved to operators.

D represents a diagonal matrix of order 3 x 3 which includes the number of workers in a similar company last year; b is a column vector of three rows, it indicates the number of workers at the present moment. As the company has just developped we are just 4 managers. 
There are expected to be 1 managers, 0 engineers and 1 operators in the future (a year from now). Taking into account that for the computations we are 4 managers and for the final results we have taken the integer numbers.

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
The forecast for the firms demand for workers has been computed by applying OLS regression to available data in which y is a column vector of dimension 9 that contents historical data on demand for workers in each of the 3 occupations in 2 different years.
X is a 9x4 matrix that contains historical data on the labor market indicator in each of the 3 occupations and in 2 different years.
In order to estimate the beta and the dummy variables we have used python. We have done the inverse of the transpose of X times X and all this multiplied by the transpose of X and times y.
Second, we needed to make predictions on 3D life´s demand for workers. For this, we have plugged the estimated coefficients into the linear model. More precisely, we have multiplied the estimated unemployment rates by the estiamted betas and dummy variables that we have previously obtained.

We have predicted that the need for workers would be 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators in a year from now. This corresponds to the firm 3Dlife demand for workers. 

In order to detect mismatches we will compare the predicted available workers with the predicted need workers. 
The number of available workers in the future forecasted was 1 manager, 0 engineers and 1 operator. With our last calculation, we have come to the conclusion that we will need 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators. Therefore, by computing the difference we can predict a shortage for all the occupations. For managers 3 (4-1), for engineers 12 (12-0) and for operators 6 (7-1).  

This means that we will have to take an upsizing strategy to prevent this shortage, in which availability is smaller than demand. For this we will hire more workers, more precisely 3 managers, 12 engineers and 6 operators. Another strategy we could take is to increase the workweek. This would imply increasing the working days our current workers spend during one week. Another option could be to increase overtime, which means increasing the amount of time a person works beyond normal working hours.
