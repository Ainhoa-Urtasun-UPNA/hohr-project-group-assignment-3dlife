## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities
***
* Your company's name: **3Dlife**
* Your company's NAICS (at least 4-digit) code and associated description from [NAICS Search](https://www.naics.com/search/): 
* **339112 Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing**
* Description: This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing medical, surgical, ophthalmic, and veterinary instruments and apparatus (except electrotherapeutic, electromedical and irradiation apparatus). Examples of products made by these establishments are syringes, hypodermic needles, anesthesia apparatus, blood transfusion equipment, catheters, surgical clamps, and medical thermometers.

* Corporate name and total employees of the top 3 businesses (Click To View Corporate Businesses by Revenue):
**3DLife Bioprinting, Inc.**
* Top 3 businesses:
* Baxter International Inc -> Total employees: 47,000
* Fresenius Medical Care North -> Total employees: 18,500
* Medline Industries Inc -> 12,000
* Total employees of the top 3 businesses = 77,500

* Number of businesses in your NAICS code from [Market Research](https://www.naics.com/market-research/): 
* 339112	- Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing =	5,737
* List of your company's primary activities divided into engineering activities and operational activities:
* Our primary activities are related directly to the creation of the multilayered objects such as tissues and organs from soft biomaterials like living cells and biomimetic synthetic polymers, using the latest technological advancement in the field. Primary activities are divided into engineering activites and operations activities. 
                 
3Dlife's research engineers mainly work theoretically and analytically, they carry out experiments before the implementation, for instance, bioprinting a heart the size of a cherry, with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers, which is developed from the patient's own fat tissue.  They will carry out studies, and prototypes, for example, using only a human cornea they can print 50 artificial ones, thanks to 3D technology. This is a big advancement in ophthalmology.                                 One important activity of the engineers is using computer-aided design (CAD) to design and map the organs which are done layer by layer.
Operational activities performed by 3Dlife's operators consist on obtaining and handling materials such as bioprinting skin, whose market is growing fast. In order to print an organ, cells of the specific organ are needed, these cells are called bioink. Operators make sure that this material is on the machine. Operators also set up the tools and machines needed for the printer, such as a print head mount, elevator, platform, sensors... 3Dlife operators carry out the production of the organs, and lastly they perform a very strict quality control to assure the highest performance of the organs created.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
